List of regression algorithms in Machine Learning
- Linear Regression
- Ridge Regression
- Neural Network Regression 
- Decision Tree Regression 
- Random Forest
- KNN Model 
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Gausian Regression
- Polynomial Regression
- - Linear regression algorithm is used if the labels are continuous, like the number of flights daily from an airport, etc. The representation of linear regression is y = b*x + c.
- - Ridge Regression : If only one independent variable is being used to predict the output, it will be termed as a linear regression ML algorithm.
- - Neural Network Regression : Each node in a neural network has a respective activation function that defines the output of the node based on a set of inputs. The last activation function can be manipulated to change a neural network into a regression model.
- - Decision Tree Regression : Non-linear regression in Machine Learning can be done with the help of decision tree regression. The main function of the decision tree regression algorithm is to split the dataset into smaller sets. 
- - Random forest is also a widely-used algorithm for non-linear regression in Machine Learning. Unlike decision tree regression (single tree), a random forest uses multiple decision trees for predicting the output. Random data points are selected from the given dataset (say k data points are selected), and a decision tree is built with them via this algorithm. Several decision trees are then modeled that predict the value of any new data point. 
- - KNN model is popularly used for non-linear regression in Machine Learning. KNN (K Nearest Neighbours) follows an easy implementation approach for non-linear regression in Machine Learning. KNN assumes that the new data point is similar to the existing data points. 
- - SVM can be placed under both linear and non-linear types of regression in ML. The use cases of SVM can range from image processing and segmentation, predicting stock market patterns, text categorization, etc.
- Applications of ML regression algorithms are as follows −
- Forecasting or Predictive analysis - For example, we can forecast GDP, oil prices or in simple words the quantitative data that changes with the passage of time.
- Optimization − We can optimize business processes with the help of regression. For example, a store manager can create a statistical model to understand the peek time of coming of customers.
- Error correction − In business, taking correct decision is equally important as optimizing the business process. Regression can help us to take correct decision as well in correcting the already implemented decision.
