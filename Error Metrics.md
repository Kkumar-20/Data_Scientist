- There are three error metrics that are commonly used for evaluating and reporting the performance of a regression model; they are: Mean Squared Error (MSE). Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- 
- RMSE is the most famous evaluation metric for the regression model. The overall calculation of RMSE is similar to MSE; the final value is square-rooted as we calculated the square of errors in MSE.
- The R2 score (pronounced R-Squared Score) is a statistical measure that tells us how well our model is making all its predictions on a scale of zero to one.
